# v88 TestFlight — restore existing GitHub secrets

The previous replacement workflow accidentally referenced a new secret naming
scheme (`P12_BASE64`, `PROFILE_BASE64`, etc.). The repository already had a
working TestFlight secret set, so those values resolved to empty strings.

This patch restores the existing secret names:

- IOS_CERTIFICATE
- IOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD
- IOS_MOBILE_PROVISION
- APPLE_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM
- APPLE_API_KEY_ID
- APPLE_API_ISSUER
- APPLE_API_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64
- SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID

No new secrets are required.

The bundle identifier is derived directly from the App Store provisioning
profile, so `HUD_BUNDLE_ID` no longer needs to be a repository secret.

The workflow also validates all required existing secrets before installing
tools or trying to sign the app.

This fixes the latest failure:
`SecKeychainItemImport: Unable to decode the provided data`

It does not alter any v88 application source code.

Note: after signing/archive is restored, App Store Connect may still return
90534 if Apple's server continues rejecting the Xcode 27 beta 4 toolchain.
That is a separate external toolchain issue.
